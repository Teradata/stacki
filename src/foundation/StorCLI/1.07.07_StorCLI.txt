Important Notes:
==================
STORCLI PHASE 2.0 Specific Limitations:
1.	User can use both 'raid0' and 'r0' for mentioning the raid level. And user can find both the forms in the help command.
2.	When passing parameter,'set' for CC mode is mandatory. 
3.	The use of comma in between array no and row parameter in the syntax for making pdreplacemissing should not be used.
4.	User would not be able to specify ROWs while creating Dedicated Hot Spare. Instead user needs to use Drive Group ID as dgs=N
5.	In Foreign Configuration show, utility will display VD as Foreign instead of showing the VD state.
6.	The success code and description is printed only after complete processing of the command. Success will not be printed unless the entire log is displayed to the output. Hence the success code and description is printed at the end of the log for this particular command.
7.	Any command syntax is still valid, if user uses - instead of /  for e.g. storcli.exe /c0-vall show.
8.	Show Bus and PCI Slot type are not shown as part of the controller information.
9.	While creating a VD using non-Enc-ID Devices, user needs to provide inputs in the format D:SlotID as syntax (for eg: Drives=D:1,2,3 where 1,2,3 are the slot ids of the non encID devices)
10.	Tape Drives will be listed only with /c0/sall show all command, /c0/sall show doesnt list Tape drive but only display the direct attached drives if present or a blank table if none are connected.
11.	Importing Foreign Configuration while Rebuild is in progress then query for Show fall the output would display multiple R60 VDs.
12.	Date and Time of controller is not displayed in proper format in EFI Environment 
13.	JSON is not required in EFI
14.	The sector size of the drives are displayed in KB instead of bytes under the PD List table. This is just display error in tabular format but it is displayed correctly in drive details.
15.	The Eid:slot column while importing a foreign config is not populated. StorCLI: The VD name cannot contain spaces as allowed in MSM.
16.	Consistency Check cannot be scheduled beyond year-2037AD.
17.	Flashing 9260CV low-level controller firmware is supported only through DOS version of CLI (MegaCLI) and not through EFI version of StorCLI.  Flashing MegaRAID firmware does not have this issue.

Known Behavior:
1.	All VD initialization command when run through StorCLI utility, shows the error message as failed for cachecaded VD. This is a generic limitation.
2.	While reconstruction is in progress, start of CC/Init/BGI operations on same VD throws an inappropriate error message. This is a generic limitation.
3.	In controller show cc the field CC current state will change only when it meets the schedule CC parameters.
4.	All the unsupported commands for SWR controller if tried to execute may result in unknown behavior for example  system hang-up. For the list of unsupported commands refer to user guide Appendix C: Unsupported Commands in Embedded RAID.
5.	Output for controller information contains junk characters in VMware ESXi 4.1 update2.  
6.	FDE drives are displayed as secured drives on SWR- SCU controller.
7.	There is no check to see whether user has entered different properties or the same property multiple times in StorCLI command. Hence StorCLI  does not throw syntax error for the command /c0/dall show all all all. This issue is because of the implementation of accepting multiple properties in a single command line in some cases.

Important Notes:
==================
1.  User can use both raid0 and r0 for mentioning the raid level. And user can find both the forms in the help command.
2.  When passing parameter set' for CC mode is mandatory. 
3.  The use of comma in between array no and row parameter in the syntax for making pdreplacemissing should not be used.
4.  User would not be able to specify ROWs while creating Dedicated Hot Spare. Instead user needs to use Drive Group ID as dgs=N
5.  In Foreign Configuration show, utility will display VD as Foreign instead of showing the VD state.
6.  The success code and description is printed only after complete processing of the command. Success will not be printed unless the entire log is displayed to the output. The success code and description is printed at the end of the log for this particular command.
7.  Any command syntax is still valid, if user uses - instead of /  (e.g. storcli.exe /c0-vall show.)
8.  Show Bus and PCI Slot type are not shown as part of the controller information.
9.  While creating a VD using non-Enc-ID Devices, user needs to provide inputs in the format D:SlotID as syntax (e.g. Drives=D:1,2,3 where 1,2,3 are the slot ids of the non encID devices.)
10. Tape Drives will be listed only with /c0/sall show all command. /c0/sall show doesnt list Tape drive but only displays the direct attached drives if present or a blank table if none are connected.
11. Importing Foreign Configuration while Rebuild is in progress then query for Show fall the output would display multiple R60 VDs.
12. For any operation (Migrate/Init/BGI/CC) percentile completed in minutes is not displayed in StorCLI output. 
13. All VD initialization command when run through StorCLI utility, shows the error message as failed for cachecaded VD.
14. While reconstruction is in progress, start of CC/Init/BGI operations on same VD throws an inappropriate error message.
15. In controller show cc the field CC current state will change only when it meets the schedule CC parameters.
