<title> Testing Your Roll </title>

<para>
After you build the ISO image, burn the image to a CD.
</para>

<para>
Then, find a test machine and, at a minimum, get the Rocks Base CD
and the HPC Roll CD.
Then follow the frontend installation instructions from the Rocks
web site.
When the installer asks if you have a roll CD, answer 'yes' and put in the
HPC Roll.
When it asks if you have another roll, put in yours.
</para>

<para>
Early in roll development, there is good chance your roll will trigger
an exception in the installer.
Many times, this is due to a syntax error in one of your XML files found
in the
<computeroutput>nodes</computeroutput> or 
<computeroutput>graphs</computeroutput> directories.
</para>

<para>
To perform a quick syntax check on your XML files, execute:
</para>

<screen>
# cd roll/&lt;roll name&gt;
# kpp &lt;file in nodes directory&gt;
</screen>

<para>
For example, in the Intel Roll, to perform a syntax check on the
file 
<computeroutput>roll/intel/nodes/intel.xml</computeroutput>, we execute:
</para>

<screen>
# cd roll/intel
# kpp intel
</screen>

<para>
If there is a syntax error, you'll receive a python exception error
message from 
<computeroutput>kpp</computeroutput>.
</para>

<para>
You may see an error that looks like:
</para>

<screen>
kpp error - cannot find node "&lt;filename&gt;"
</screen>

<para>
This means that your graph file has made a reference to a node that is
not in your roll, 
where <emphasis>&lt;filename&gt;</emphasis> is reference to a node in
another roll.
To work around this, create a symbolic link in the nodes directory
to the missing node file.
This file is most likely in
<computeroutput>/home/install/profiles/current/nodes</computeroutput>.
</para>

<para>
For example, if kpp's error is:
</para>

<screen>
kpp error - cannot find node "client"
</screen>

<para>
Then the work around is:
</para>

<screen>
# cd roll/&lt;roll name&gt;/nodes
# ln -s /home/install/profiles/current/nodes/client.xml client.xml
</screen>

<para>
Then try to execute kpp again.
</para>

<warning>
<para>
If you add a symbolic link to your nodes directory, make sure to remove it
before you build your roll.
If you don't, the link will be included in your roll and cause the
installation to fail.
</para>
</warning>

<para>
If your XML files are syntactically clean, but the installer still throws
an exception, you'll have to closely examine your XML code.
</para>

<para>
Also, you can click the 'Debug' button from the installer and start to
look at the installer's python code.
The Rocks team has implemented extensions to RedHat's installer and 
this code can be found under
<computeroutput>/home/install/profiles/current/include/</computeroutput>.
Also, the source code for RedHat's installer can be found by expanding
a tarball in the Rocks source tree:
</para>

<screen>
# cd src/rocks/boot/enterprise/3/loader
# make anaconda-9.1
</screen>

<para>
This will deposit the code for RedHat's installer in the directory
<computeroutput>anaconda-9.1</computeroutput>.
</para>

<title> Using kgen to the Kickstart File </title>

<para>
Once your XML is syntatically clean, you can use
<computeroutput>kgen</computeroutput> to see what the resulting
RedHat-compliant kickstart file will look like for your nodes files.
</para>

<para>
Using the Intel Roll as a guide, execute the following:
</para>

<screen>
# cd roll/intel
# kpp intel | kgen
</screen>

<para>
You'll see a RedHat-compliant kickstart file -- but it only has kickstart
commands relevant to the Intel Roll.
</para>

<para>
Often, you can cut portions from the <emphasis>%post</emphasis> section and
run the shell commands to test specific post installation procedures, but
do this with caution as the commands will alter the configuration on the
host in which you run it.
</para>
