# gonna get some serious 'star power' off this commit.
#
# put in code to dynamically configure the static-routes file based on
# networks (no longer the hardcoded 'eth0').

# Revision 1.4  2009/07/21 21:50:51  bruno
# fix help
#
# Revision 1.3  2009/06/19 21:07:25  mjk
# - added dumpHostname to dump commands (use localhost for frontend)
# - added add commands for attrs
# - dump uses add for attr (does not overwrite installer set attrs)A
# - do not dump public or private interfaces for the frontend
# - do not dump os/arch host attributes
# - fix various self.about() -> self.abort()

# Revision 1.1  2009/03/13 00:02:59  mjk
# - checkpoint for route commands
# - gateway is dead (now a default route)
# - removed comment rows from schema (let's see what breaks)
# - removed short-name from appliance (let's see what breaks)
# - dbreport static-routes is dead
