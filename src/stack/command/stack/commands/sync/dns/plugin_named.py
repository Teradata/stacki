# Overhaul of the naming system. We now support
# 1. Multiple zone/domains
# 2. Serving DNS for multiple domains
# 3. No FQDN support for network names
#    - FQDN must be split into name & domain.
#    - Each piece information will go to a
#      different table
# Hopefully, I've covered the basics, and not broken
# anything major
