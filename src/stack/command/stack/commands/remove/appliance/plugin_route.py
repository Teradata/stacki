# Bug fix
# "rocks remove appliance" runs "rocks remove appliance route" plugin
# without any args. "remove appliance route" cannot be run without args,
# and "rocks remove appliance" fails. So now instead of calling the command,
# the plugin runs sql directly to remove appropriate entries from the
# appliance routes table;
