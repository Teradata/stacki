		Expands the given list of names to valid cluster hostnames.	A name can be:

		- hostname
		- IP address
		- MAC address
		- where COND (e.g. 'where appliance=="backend"')

		Any combination of these is valid.  If the names list
		is empty a list of all hosts in the cluster is
		returned.

		The 'managed_only' flag means that the list of hosts will
		*not* contain hosts that traditionally don't have ssh login
		shells (for example, the following appliances usually don't
		have ssh login access: 'Ethernet Switches', 'Power Units',
		'Remote Management')

		The 'host_filter' flag is a callable (function, lambda, etc)
		that will be passed along with the final host list to filter().
		Equivalent code would look something like this:
		[host for host in final_host_list if host_filter(host)]

		Because filter() requires the callable to have only one arg,
		to allow access to 'self' as well as the host, host_filter()
		and 'self' are frozen with 'functools.partial', even if 'self'
		isn't required.	 The second arg will be each host name in the list.
