		# • `sync host` will always overwrite /etc/hosts on the FE
		# • `sync config` will always call `sync host`
		# • `sync host network` will respect the `sync.hosts` attr and
		#    conditionally re-write /etc/hosts on backends.
		# • `sync host network` always calls `sync config`
		# • `sync host network localhost` therefore does not respect
		#    the attribute for the FE
		# note: 'sync.hosts' implicitly defaults to `False`, meaning
		#    don't rewrite /etc/hosts on backends
		#
		# The net effect is that we always want to rewrite the hostfile
		# for the FE (FE needs to know how to get ahold of hosts), but
		# only do the backends if we're explicitly asked to do so.
