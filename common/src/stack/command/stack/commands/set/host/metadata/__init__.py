class Command(stack.commands.set.host.command):
	"""
	Set the metadata for a list of hosts. The metadata is
	reserved for the user and is not used internally by Stacki. The
	intention is to provide a mechanism similar to the AWS
	meta-data to allow arbitrary data to be attached to a host.

	It is recommended that the metadata (if used) should be a JSON
	document but there are no assumptions from Stacki on the
	structure of the data.

	Metadata should be accessed using the "metadata" read-only attribute.

	<arg type='string' name='host' repeat='1'>
	One or more host names.
	</arg>

	<param type='string' name='metadata' optional='0'>
	The metadata document
	</param>
