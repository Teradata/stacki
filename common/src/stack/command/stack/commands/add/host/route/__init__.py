	"""
	Add a route for a host

	<arg type='string' name='host' repeat='1'>
	Host name of machine
	</arg>

	<param type='string' name='address'>
	Host or network address
	</param>

	<param type='string' name='gateway'>
	Network or device gateway
	</param>

	<param type='string' name='interface'>
	The interface to send the bits over. Useful if
	you want to tag a packet.
	</param>

	<param type='string' name='syncnow'>
	Add route to the routing table immediately
	</param>

	<param type='string' name='netmask'>
	Specifies the netmask for a network route.  For a host route
	this is not required and assumed to be 255.255.255.255
	</param>

	<example cmd="add host route localhost address=10.0.0.2 gateway=10.0.0.1 interface=eth1.2 syncnow=true">
	Add a host based route on the frontend to address 10.0.0.2 with the gateway 10.0.0.1
	through interface eth1.2. This will tag the packet with the vlan ID of 2.
	The syncnow flag being set to true will also add it to the live routing table so no network restart
	is needed.
