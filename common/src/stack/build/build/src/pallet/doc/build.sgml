<title> Making a Roll ISO </title>

<para>
To build an ISO image of your roll, go the the directory:
<computeroutput>roll/&lt;roll name&gt;</computeroutput> and
execute:
</para>

<screen>
# make roll
</screen>

<para>
This will start a process that goes into the 
<computeroutput>src</computeroutput> directory
and creates RPMS for each software package (as specified by their
respective spec files), copies the newly built RPMs into the directory
<computeroutput>RPMS</computeroutput>.
</para>

<para>
Then a directory named 
<computeroutput>iso</computeroutput> is created.
It will be the structure of the ISO, that is, 
<computeroutput>mkisofs</computeroutput> looks into this directory and
makes an ISO image based on it.
</para>

<para>
When you look at your ISO image, you'll see a file of the form:
<computeroutput>
roll-&lt;roll name&gt;-kickstart-3.1.0-0.noarch.rpm</computeroutput>.
This RPM was automatically built for you and it contains the files found
in the 
<computeroutput>nodes</computeroutput> directory
and the 
<computeroutput>graphs</computeroutput> directory.
This file is what the installer looks at in order to recognize your roll
and properly install it.
</para>

<para>
After you successfully build your roll, you should see a file of the 
form:
<computeroutput>
roll-&lt;roll name&gt;-3.1.0-0.&lt;arch&gt;.iso</computeroutput>.
This is the ISO image for your roll.
</para>

<para>
For example, the Intel Roll's ISO image for the i386 architecture is
named:
<computeroutput>roll-intel-3.1.0-0.i386.iso</computeroutput>.
</para>
