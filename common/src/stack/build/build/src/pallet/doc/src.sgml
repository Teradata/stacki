<title> src Directory </title>

<para>
If your roll requires RPMs to be built from source, you'll place the
tarballs under the
<computeroutput>src</computeroutput> directory.
If your roll doesn't need to build any source code, that is, it only
includes downloaded pre-built RPMS, then the 
<computeroutput>src</computeroutput> directory is not needed and you
should skip this step.
</para>

<para>
Looking at the Intel Roll, you'll see the file:
<computeroutput>roll/intel/src/Makefile</computeroutput>.
Copy this file into your 
<computeroutput>src</computeroutput> directory.
You will not need to modify this file -- it simply drives the source code
building process.
</para>

<para>
Now, in the Intel Roll, you'll see the directory:
<computeroutput>roll/intel/src/mpich-eth</computeroutput>.
Inside that directory, you'll see:
<computeroutput>Makefile, mpich-1.2.5.2.tar.gz, mpich.spec.in
and patch-files</computeroutput>.
</para>

<para>
The file <computeroutput>mpich-1.2.5.2.tar.gz</computeroutput> is
the tarball as downloaded from the MPICH web site.
</para>

<para>
The directory <computeroutput>patch-files</computeroutput> is used to
patch some of the files inside the mpich tarball.
If you don't need to patch any files, ignore this directory.
</para>

<para>
The file <computeroutput>mpich.spec.in</computeroutput> is a RedHat
spec file that directs <computeroutput>rpmbuild</computeroutput>
on how to assemble the RPM.
For an in-depth description of spec files, see
<ulink url="http://www.rpm.org/max-rpm/">Maximum RPM</ulink>.
</para>

<para>
The file <computeroutput>Makefile</computeroutput> drives the building
of the RPM.
</para>

<para>
Copy the files 
<computeroutput>Makefile and mpich.spec.in</computeroutput> to your
<computeroutput>src</computeroutput> directory and experiment with them
in order to build an RPM for your source code.
</para>
