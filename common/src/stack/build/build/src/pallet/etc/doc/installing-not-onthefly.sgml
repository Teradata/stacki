$Log$
Revision 1.2  2011/01/28 02:17:28  mjk
Docbook cleanup (using Viz Roll as proto-type)
- consistent entity naming (no more mixing of '-' and '_')
- roll compat page only lists specified rolls (version.mk)
- added note about using all OS cds with non-core rolls (e.g. viz)
- added entities for roll names, and bools
- logical styles used instead of direct formatting
  e.g. constant vs. emphasis
Works for Viz (needs new devel env installed)
TODO: Update Base Roll to further standardize (slow)
TODO: Cleanup all other Rolls (fast)
