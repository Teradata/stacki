stack add pallet [pallet ...] [clean=bool] [dir=string] [password=string] [updatedb=string] [username=string]

Description

	Add pallet ISO images to this machine's pallet directory. This command
	copies all files in the ISOs to the local machine. The default location
	is a directory under /export/stack/pallets.

	
Arguments

	[pallet ...]

	A list of pallet ISO images to add to the local machine. If no list is
	supplied, then if a pallet is mounted on /mnt/cdrom, it will be copied
	to the local machine. If the pallet is hosted on the internet, it will
	be downloaded and stored on the local machine.
	

Parameters

	[clean=bool]

	If set, then remove all files from any existing pallets of the same
	name, version, and architecture before copying the contents of the
	pallets onto the local disk.  This parameter should not be set
	when adding multi-CD pallets such as the OS pallet, but should be set
	when adding single pallet CDs such as the Grid pallet.

	The base directory to copy the pallet to.
	The default is: /export/stack/pallets.
