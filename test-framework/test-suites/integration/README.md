# Integration Tests

In the test framework, integration tests are for testing our code at the level of full stack commands. Each PyTest file should focus on testing a single stack command.

In between tests, the MySQL database is rolled back to the state before tests were run. This is done by the  `revert_database` fixture automatically, so you do not need to include it in your testing code.

**Any other side-effects caused by your tests will need to be undone** after your test has run, even if your test has failed. The frontend should be brought back to the same exact state between test runs.

## Test Organization and Structure

The tests themselves live in the `tests` directory, and are organized in subfolders based on the stack "verb" (EX: add, list, remove, etc). The PyTest files are named after the command run, for example `stack add group` would be in file `test_add_group.py`.

There are empty test files for all the stack commands, at the time I ran `generate-test-stubs.sh`. You can re-run that script safely to generate blank test file stubs, if new stack commands are added.

The tests themselves should be organized in a class named after the command, for example `stack add group` should have a class named "TestAddGroup". The test functions exist in that class and began with "test_".

An example test class structure would look like (function bodies excluded):
```
class TestAddGroup:
	def test_no_args(self, host):
		...

	def test_single_arg(self, host):
		...

	def test_multiple_args(self, host):
		...

	def test_duplicate(self, host):
		...
```

As you develop tests, if you find yourself doing the same set up or tear down code repeatedly, you can consolidate that code into a PyTest fixture. Place your new fixture in [tests/conftest.py](tests/conftest.py) and it will be automatically loaded into PyTest.

If your test required some static files, you can place them in the `files` directory. You can use the `test_file` fixture in your tests, and call it with the path to your test file, relative from the `files` directory, to get the full path.

## Test Development Workflow

Here is the workflow I use when developing new tests:

1. Change into the root of the `test-framework` directory and run `make` to build the framework, if you haven't previously built it.

2. Change into the `test-suites/integration/` directory.

3. Run `./set-up.sh STACKI_ISO`, where STACKI_ISO is the path to the Stacki ISO you want to use while developing tests. STACKI_ISO can also be a URL, which will cause the ISO to be downloaded and used. This will bring up a Stacki frontend into a Vagrant VM, which the tests will be run in.

4. OPTIONAL - You can pass a `--use-src` flag to the `set-up.sh` script, which will mount the Stacki source files into
the VM and replace all the installed Stacki files with symlinks to your source versions.

For example, to set up a clean development environment, I'll run:
```
./set-up.sh --use-src http://stacki-builds.labs.teradata.com/<LATEST_URL_HERE>
```

Then I can edit my local copy of the source files, and the changes will be reflected in the VM. I'll log in to the VM
to test out my changes on the command line, as I make them (see step 6).

5. You can now run `./run-tests.sh` to run the tests stored in the `tests` directory. You can run this as many time as you need to as you develop your new tests.

6. If you want to just run the specific test you are working on, you can SSH directly into the frontend with the command: `vagrant ssh frontend`. Switch to root user and then you can run `pytest` directly. The "tests" directory on the VM host (IE: your laptop running Vagrant) is mounted in the frontend at `/export/test-suites/integration/tests`.

7. When you are done with the frontend, or need to rebuild it, run `./tear-down.sh` to destroy the VM.

## Running Tests On An Existing Frontend

While I feel that developing tests in a clean and known VM environment is safest, it is possible to run the tests on an existing frontend.

The tests will obviously be ran against the frontend code and database, so might fail if the data in the database doesn't match a freshly barnacled system. It may also completely light your server on fire; you get to keep the ashes.

1. Copy the test-suites directory `stacki/test-framework/test-suites` to the frontend at `/export/test-suites`.

2. Logged into the frontend as root, run `pytest /export/test-suites/integration/tests` to run all the integration tests. You can pass `pytest` a specific test file if you just want to run the tests within, or even a specific test in a given file.
